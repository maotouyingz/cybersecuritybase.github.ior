          <h1 id="part-intro">Introduction to Cyber Security</h1>
        </header>

	<p>Software is everywhere and it needs to be secure. This can be hard to achive, but many methodologies for securing systems exist today. They all try to answer the same fundamental set of questions.</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>What are we protecting?</li>
	  <li>Are there any known threats and vulnerabilities?</li>
	  <li>What are the impacts to the organization if the data is lost or leaked?</li>
	  <li>What is the value of the data to the organization?</li>
	  <li>What can be done to mitigate the risks?</li>
	</ul>

	      <p><i>Asset, threat, vulnerability,</i> and <i>exploit</i> are the most commonly-used terms in the cyber security  lingo. Depending on the literature some of these terms overlap and are sometimes used synonymously.</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>An asset is what we are trying to protect. An asset is something that has some value to its owner. The value can be tangible or intangible, e.g., gold or data.</li>
	  <li>A threat of which the definition says along the lines of, "a statement of an intention to cause damage". For cyber security this is a hostile act aimed at an asset, i.e., the system. Regardless of the attackers intent of not doing any harm, a threat is still a threat. The one who poses a threat is commonly called a threat actor.</li>
	  <li>A vulnerability which is a defect in the target system. This defect may be a bug in the code for some application or a flaw in the design of the system. Vulnerabilities can also be consequences of improper configurations or user actions.</li>
	  <li>An exploit is a way to take advantage of a known vulnerability. The usual objective is to take control over the asset. One should also remember that social engineering is one kind of exploit, although sometimes considered as a scam.</li>
	</ul>

	<aside class="info">
	  <br/>
	  <h1>The risk</h1>

	  <p>One cannot build a perfect defence system against all the threats. The question is what amount of risk are you ready to accept versus the cost of mitigating the threats. More effort into protection, less risk to tolerate. The risk can be minimized but not removed completely!</p>

	<h1>What is Cyber Security and Why Should We Care About it?</h1>

	<p>Software is literally everywhere. In the olden days the software resided on the mainframes and only few people were in contact with it. A bit later personal computer was invented and by its popularity the software moved to the homes. Although, in the homes the software was still restricted and the attacker had to visit the target.</p>

	<p>One day the Internet spawned and globally connected all those personal computers and their sofware. This made it easier for the attackers as they no longer needed to physically visit the target (we shall not forget that Internet is also pretty good thing for non-attackers too). The evolution of computers kept rolling on and one day we were introduced to cellular phones and eventually smart phones, which are basically small scale computers with wireless connectivity.</p>

	<p>Currently we are on the brink of Internet of things, which promises to connect every device to the internet. For example, we have smart TVs, smart locks, smart cars, smart toasters etc. The software ranges from large, such as the operating system, to small, such as the USB driver.</p>

	<p>There is going to be an explosion in the number of devices needing software. It has been said that by the year 2020 there will be 50 billion connections and devices. This poses a growing need for code and software developers, who will have great pressure to write both functional and secure code in a limited timeframe. Sometimes the developers may face unrealistic time schedules to rush the code out to production.</p>

	<p>In addition to the growing need for more code, the code base has gotten more complex. Every machine is connected and larger systems are distributed into the network. Different parts of the systems may be developed by different vendors and they have to interoperate. Moreover, most of the current day systems are based on software frameworks which enlarges the code footprint of even a small applications. On top of everything, many of the systems are extensible with plugins and addons.</p>

	<p>Combining the connectivity, complexity, and extensibility, we get a pretty attack surface for the attacker to work with. Thus, it is perhaps not surprising, that the number of vulnerabilities in software has steadily risen over the years. Vulnerabilities and their statistics can be queried from National Vulnerability Database and from Common Vulnerability and Exposure database (<a href="https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/statistics" target="_blank" onclick="trackOutbound('https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/statistics'); return false;">NVD statistics query page</a> and <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cve/cve.html" target="_blank" onclick="trackOutbound('http://cve.mitre.org/cve/cve.html'); return false;">CVE</a>). </p>

	<p>For the attackers the attacking will stay easier than defending as long as the attacker can attack anywhere and defenders have to defend everywhere. However, with a successful security analysis many of the obvious vulnerabilites (in other words remove the low hanging fruits) can be found. This doesn't necessarily mean a system is secure, but that the system should be able to withstand unskilled hackers and automated attacks.</p>

	<aside class="info">
	  <br/>
	  <h1>Vulnerabilities are hard to find</h1>

	  <p>Even though the software or/and the protocol it implements is at its mature phase they may still hold surprises. Below are some examples of some "recent" vulnerabilities found in well known and highly used pieces of software.</p>

	<p>The world is changing and cyber security is a fast growing global issue. Adversaries come in many shapes from script kiddies to foreign governments and organized crime. Regardless of the adversary, they all have an easy access to very sophisticated and powerful technologies. Moreover, some of the attacks are so sneaky that they are evident only after the hack has happened.</p>

	<p>The attacks can result in much mayhem and harm with significant monetary losses. However, the business impact of a security breach can be difficult to tell. It is an area where it is hard to reach defenitive and representative figure or findings. However, a study from <a href="https://www.cpni.gov.uk/documents/publications/2014/oxford-economics-cyber-effects-uk-companies.pdf?epslanguage=en-gb" target="_blank" onclick="trackOutbound('https://www.cpni.gov.uk/documents/publications/2014/oxford-economics-cyber-effects-uk-companies.pdf?epslanguage=en-gb'); return false;">Oxford Economics</a> represents a set of findings based on surveys and case studies. Those findings show that cyber attacks indeed result in major business impact on victims.</p>


	<div class="quiznator-plugin" data-quiz-id="580e46df5e63c20003e538cf"></div>

	<p>The job of a vulnerability researcher is to come up with recommendations on minimizing the risk for an organization. The tasks of protecting enterprise systems and data include establishing policies, practices and tools that lower the risk of foul behaviour. The technical security assessments that the vulnerability researchers are performing include identification of vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and weaknesses that may, e.g, lead to unauthorized access.</p>

	<h2>Media Reports only the Tip of the Iceberg</h2>

	<p>Security related news have become more and more common. We see breach news in an increasing rate. These media reports are no longer small news buried somewhere in the miscallaneous news but instead they are prominent front-page material. Everything from baby monitors, to security cameras, to cars, and even luxury yachts have been targeted and hacked. The threats they talk about have become more complex and more professional. Stolen password lists have become sought after merchandise and news about targeted ransomware attacks have been seen in unprecedented rate. This tells a grim truth about the fact that our online lives have become an easy way for criminals to make money. Furthermore, these threats do not pose danger only to our online life but they can be major threats to our current way of life and it cuts across all industries, countries, and social spaces.</p>

	<p>Although, we have seen that media is starting to take breach news seriously and there are studies such as <a href="http://www.crimesurvey.co.uk/" target="_blank">Crime Survey of England and Wales</a> from the Office of National Statistics showing that the incidents are increasing. However, it is commonly believed that cyber crime still remains as under reported area of crimes.</p>

	<p>The above conveys a bleak picture of the current state of things. However, in the same time governments, organizations, corporations and institutions are putting more and more money, research and effort into fighting the situation.</p>

	<h2>Cyber Security is (Not Only) a Tech Problem</h2>

	<p>News of security breaches are full of things such as hackers using their own radio set ups to misguide yachts or to exploit technical vulnerabilities such as the possibility to reprogram the firmware of an USB device to hide malicious code. The news have the tendency to sound technical when they try to explain the root cause for the vulnerability that was exloited. However, security is multidisciplinary in the sense that effective security comes from understanding the vulnerabilities that may come from the physical environment, technology, or from the human element in the mix. The threats coming from physical environment includes things such as fires, natural disasters, stolen computers, exposed cables, etc. The technical threats are what this course considers in more detail. However, there is a strong human element in cyber security. The best security safeguards in the world count for very little if:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Someone accidentally emails out a file of bank details to a wrong address.</li>
	  <li>Someone copies a set of sensitive documents to a memory stick which gets stolen.</li>
	  <li>In many organizations the staff get portable devices such as phones, laptops, tablets, etc. Those portable devices go where the staff goes. The portable devices may have sensitive data on them. The devices may be stolen, or they might be left somewhere by mistake. It is surprisingly common that people forget their laptops to planes, coffee houses, etc. Encrypting the devices and enforcing a policy of hard to crack passwords goes a long way to protect agains this. However, strong passwords are hard for humans to remember.</li>
	  <li>The staff may use their private emails for corporate communication, which may or may not be protected.</li>
	  <li>The staff may receive attachments that are dubious and open them, or the staff may visit a website and be the target of a drive-by download of a malicious piece of code.</li>
	  <li>The office staff may discuss something work related in social media or take a photo from the work place revealing something by mistake, e.g, some plans on a whiteboard, and depending on their privacy settings this may leak to wrong people.</li>
	  <li>...all of the above by a very disgruntled employee doing it on purpose.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>It is evident, from the list above, that human actions in the office can be seen as threat. These threats can be deterred by educating the staff and giving them knowledge about the correct cyber security procedures. Care has to be taken in the way how the procedures are communicated as the audience is broad and may or may not be technically aware.</p>

	<p>In short, cyber security is everyone's business. The designers and implementers build systems that have no holes (well, as few as possible), the operations people build and maintain secure networks, administrators keep the systems upto date and configured correctly, users should prefer secure software, and executives should invest in security early on.</p>


	<h2>Responsibilities and Liabilities</h2>


	<p>On this course we are not going to go delve deep into the law but we make a note that companies and corporations have responsibilities and liabilities over the data they gather. Most companies and corporations have made commitment (legal or not) to treat the data that they gather with the utmost care. In addition, there are laws and regulations that govern the way the companies and corporations have to secure their data and tell them what is the correct procedure after the breach has happened.</p>

	<p>As an example of the regulations governing the companies, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation (EU) <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679#d1e6226-1-1" target="_blank" onclick="trackOutbound('http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679#d1e6226-1-1'); return false;">2016/679</a>) intends to unify and simplify the regulations for data protection withing the European Union. The GDPR is intended to replace the current directive for protection of personal data. The main objective of this regulation is to give people control over their personal data. Furthermore, the regulations includes matters such as export of personal data outside of the EU, sanctions for the non-compliant parties, right to erasure, and data breach reporting procedure. This regulation comes into force in 25th of May 2018.</p>

	<p>The GDPR is the first market economical grounds for data protection. Similarly as the environmental regulations has internalized the cost of the environmental legislation to the products we may see the same happening with data protection. The insurance companies have also noticed the impending GDPR as they have introduced cyber security insurances which would cover some of the costs caused by a breach, such as loss of profit.</p>

	<div class="quiznator-plugin" data-quiz-id="580e49e55e63c20003e538d2"></div>

	<p>However, the law is for the law abiding people, for the criminal it is just a deterrent. It has been said that the Internet can provide anonymity and distance the attacker from its victim so that it is easier to step into the world of crime via the Internet. When talking about hacking we have to mention about ethical hacking. An ethical hacker is a expert who tries to penetrate to a computer system, but does it with permission from the system owner. The purpose of this is to find security vulnerabilities that the malicious ones could potentially exploit.</p>

	<aside class="info">
	  <br/>
	  <h1></h1>

	  <p>TL;DR Breaking into computers is illegal, use common sense.</p>

	  <p>This information is provided for educational purposes and not for causing malicious or damaging attacks. Performing any penetration testing requires permission from the owner of the target. Moreover, it should be noted that the target may recide on same server with other services. So permission from the service provider may also be needed.</p>
	</aside>


	<h2>STRIDE and DREAD</h2>

	<p>When you start the development of a new application there are few things that should be considered from the start. From the point of view of this course series, we naturally take the stance that the security is the biggest. It is essential to apply some kind of threat modelling in the design phase. If not, the application may have serious flaws or the effort for security is wasted on the wrong part of the application. In the process of threat modelling you look at the application and decompose it to smaller parts (features and modules) that do a certain thing. From the parts the threats are identified and from the threats the vulnerabilities. This can continue with each of the parts to even smaller parts.</p>

	<p>Different kind of actors may find the threats. For example, an ordinary user may stumble on a flaw in the application or a script kiddie running automated tools may discover a flaw, or motivated attacker may find a flaw in the application. The threats may have impact on the applications such as authorization may fail and allow unauthorized access, browser cache may contain something it should not, eavesdropping, etc. There are multiple ways to do classification of the threats to ease the modelling. For example, STRIDE and DREAD. They are good checklists for different kinds of threat classes but not exhaustive lists.</p>

	<h3>The STRIDE threat model</h3>

	<p>The STRIDE Threat Model is a useful check list of questions that can help you in threat modelling your application. STRIDE comes from an acronym for the following threat categories, <i>Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege</i>. Spoofing covers cases where someone is illegally accessing a system and using another user’s authentication information. Tampering of the data covers cases such as unauthorized changes made to persistent data. This can happen inside a machine or in the transport. Repudiation threats are such that the system should be able to trace actions of users operations so that the system has evidence of what has happened. Information disclosure is exposing information to individuals who are not supposed to have access to the information. This category can also happen in the machine or during transport. Denial of Service refers to cases where the server or service is made temporarily unavailable. Elevation of privileges is a threat type in which unprivileged user finds a way to gain sufficient privileges to compromise the system.</p>

	<h3>DREAD risk assessment model</h3>

	<p>DREAD is a mnemonic checklist for prioritizing the threats based on their severity. It is a acronym that comes from <i>Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users, Discoverability</i>. Which are pretty self explanatory. Although, discussion has been had about the discoverability and that it would favor security through obscurity, which is not good. A scale from 0-10 is usually used in all categories, except discoverability which is often just set to 10 as the threats will be found eventually.</p>


	<h2>Read and reflect</h2>

	<p>Read the following article and answer the question (in about 300 words): "Do you find mnemonic lists meaningful or not? Justify your opinion."</p>
